## Overview

Strategy, programming guidelines, upcoming projects and more!

### Background

Read-only, detailed .githubrmation about `opennudge`
organization and its operations.

### Actors

- [opennudge](https://opennudge.com) - organization providing core
    security features

### Actions

No sensitive data or source code is used except for `.github/workflows` actions
directly adapted from [`opentemplate`](https://github.com/open-nudge/opentemplate).

Rest is composed of markup files, such as `markdown` and `yaml`.

### Goals

Provide comprehensive .githubrmation about the `opennudge` organization.

### Non-goals

Any source-code or sensitive data __will not__ be used in the repository.

## Self-assessment use

This self-assessment was automatically generated by the
[`opentemplate`](https://github.com/open-nudge/opentemplate)
template to provide basic security .githubrmation about the project.
__It should be extended by adding project-specific security .githubrmation.__

> [!IMPORTANT]
> [opennudge](https://opennudge.com)
> does not intend to provide a security audit of the project
> or function as an independent assessment or attestation
> of its security posture.

| template  | Critical      | Base GitHub template of the repository provided by `opennudge`. Used to provide initial security posture (pipelines, pre-commit, practices, hardening etc.) See [open-nudge/.github](https://github.com/open-nudge/.github) for more .githubrmation |

## Project compliance

Project tries to comply with the following security standards:

- [SLSA](https://slsa.dev/) - L3+ if the project is public or coming
    from a GitHub Enterprise Account with Advanced Security, L2 otherwise
- The project is currently not third-party audited or verified

## Secure development practices

### Deployment pipeline

Core of the deployment pipeline is based on the following tools:

- [opentemplate](https://github.com/open-nudge/opentemplate):
    see [open-nudge/opentemplate](https://github.com/open-nudge/opentemplate)
    for more .githubrmation

### Communication channels

You can reach out to us by
[Private Security Reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
or by:

- means of communication provided at the account level [here](https://github.com/open-nudge)
- opening an issue in the repository (somebody will get back to you)

### Ecosystem

This project __is not__ a part of any ecosystem and should
be considered informational only.

## Security issue resolution

The [`open-nudge/.github`](https://github.com/open-nudge/.github)
security policy is maintained in the
[`SECURITY.md`](https://github.com/open-nudge/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md)
file.

### Responsible disclosure practice

The [`open-nudge/.github`](https://github.com/open-nudge/.github)
accepts vulnerability reports as outlined in the security policy defined in
[`SECURITY.md`](https://github.com/open-nudge/.github/blob/master/SECURITY.md#reporting-a-vulnerability.)
file.

### Incident response

Project maintainers will respond to security incidents privately
on a case-by-case basis.

## Appendix

- Project is largely aligned with the
    [Open Source Security Foundation best practices](https://www.bestpractices.dev/en)
- Some false negatives regarding the best practices were spotted
    (e.g. not using fuzzing), consult `scorecard.yml` for more .githubrmation
