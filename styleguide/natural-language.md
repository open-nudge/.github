## Linters

Use checkers/linters to automatically verify your file, suggested ones:

- [errata-ai/vale](https://github.com/errata-ai/vale) - generic linter
    for prose, multiple tools should be enabled

## Approach

- Respect your reader's time
- Only provide the necessary information
- Create small paragraphs/tutorials
- Use hyphens and formatting to focus reader's attention
- The less, the better

## Large Language Models

> [!NOTE]
> This should be the final step of your writing

Do not use it to:

- create argumentation
- structure the text
- write whole text (especially from insufficient information)

Use generative artificial intelligence to:

- fix/improve/adjust style of __already written text__
- shorten your writing
- fix typos/grammatical errors

> [!CAUTION]
> __Always__ double-check the full output generated by the model
> and adjust manually as necessary
