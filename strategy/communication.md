# Communication

## Definitions

- __Unit__ - new project or a new release of the existing project
- __Ready project__ - project which is `~90%+` ready for publishing
    (or at most one week of work left)

## Rules

- Communication is mostly one-way, from the project to the audience,
    except for:

    - technical discussions, mostly on GitHub or similar platforms
    - commercial client-related discussions, performed
        on a case-by-case basis and according to client needs
    - __main__ channel (usually with limited interaction, e.g. answering
        tech-related questions, etc.)

- All published posts are related to __Units__, no other posting activity
    allowed (with an eventual exceptions for __main__ channel)

- Comments have to be unit-related, no off-topic discussions allowed;
    possible exceptions __only__ on the main channel

## Schedule

Publishing is based on a state of __projects pipeline__, namely:

- If `5` or more units are ready, release them every week
- If `3-5` units are ready, release them every two weeks
- If `2` units are ready, release them every month
- If `1` unit is ready, release every quarter

Exact publishing schedule is subject to change based on:

- Workload and bug fixing on current projects maintenance
- Contributors availability

## Content

Content should be related to the unit and posses the following traits:

- comprehensive description

- many links to related resources

- __all links should be markdown hidden__ EXCEPT:

    - links to the project repository (e.g. GitHub)
    - links to starring the project on GitHub
    - links to LinkedIn or BlueSky profiles

- contain "boilerplate" like links to social media

### Boilerplate

These boilerplate information should be included especially in promotional
posts on Reddit or HackerNews.

## Platforms

Publishing platforms are separated into three categories:

- __targeted__ - used to publish units targeting specific audience
    and to answer unit-related questions
- __official__ - everything targeted includes, plus official
    announcements, job postings and other general information
- __main__ - one platform (subject to change), includes
    everything in official and targeted channels, plus
    a limited option to interact with the current events

The following platforms were identified:

- [bluesky](https://www.bluesky.com/) - main channel

- [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/) - official channel

- [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) - targeted channel,
    with the following subreddits (chosen based on the project's topic,
    listed in the order of audience size):

    - [r/MachineLearning](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/)
    - [r/python](https://www.reddit.com/r/python/)
    - [r/cybersecurity](https://www.reddit.com/r/cybersecurity/)
    - [r/devops](https://www.reddit.com/r/devops/)

- [hackernews](https://hackernews.com)/ - targeted channel

### Platform manager

[Buffer](https://buffer.com/) is used to manage platforms which
are available as a direct integration.

## Timing

> [!NOTE]
> Schedules target primarily US (PDT time zone) or European (UTC) audience

Essential factors to consider:

- "Work-related" platforms ([linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/)) should be
    targeted during the workweek, mornings (8:00-12:00)
- "Leisure" platforms (reddit, hackernews) should be targeted during
    weekends, evenings (18:00-22:00)
- "Informative" platforms ([bluesky](https://www.bluesky.com/)) should be
    targeted during the evenings (18:00-22:00)

> [!CAUTION]
> Schedules should be considered merely a guideline

### Specific

Timing is platform specific based on (approximate) best time to post, specifically:

- [bluesky](https://www.bluesky.com/) - evenings (18:00-22:00),
    Sunday/Saturday/Thursday; [source](https://besttimetopost.blue/howard.fm)

- [hackernews](https://hackernews.com)/ - Sunday/Saturday/Wednesday
    (mornings, 11:00-12:00)

> [!CAUTION]
